      This app uses the Open Notify API and Nominatim API, both
      are generously open source. Likewise this app is open source and available
      at my github https://github.com/underwoodno5/issflyover . Hack it, change it,
      do anything you want with it, keeping in spirit with RMS and the Free Software
      Foundation. The flag on this page was designed by reddit user _Serraphim.
